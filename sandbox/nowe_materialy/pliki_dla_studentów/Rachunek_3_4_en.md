# Student Guide: Learning Differential Calculus with Your AI Assistant

Welcome to an interactive guide to mathematical analysis! In this part we will learn the operation inverse to differentiation — integration. We will discover how to reconstruct an original function from information about its change and how to sum infinitely small quantities.

## Key to success: your activity and curiosity

**You are in charge of your learning!**

* Don't understand a term? Ask the AI: "What is the difference between a definite and an indefinite integral?"
* An example is unclear? Ask for another: "Can you show me another example of integration by parts?"
* Want to check yourself? Verify your thinking: "If I understand correctly, the definite integral of a function is simply the area under its graph, right?"

**Take responsibility for your learning**

Approach this task diligently. The goal is understanding. Failure to master the material will be your failure. Use this opportunity wisely.

## Topic 1: Indefinite integral and antiderivative

**Key concepts:** In this section you'll learn: antiderivative, indefinite integral, and the constant of integration C.

* **Step 1: Building intuition**
    * **Prompt 1.1:** "Explain what an antiderivative is. Why is it the 'inverse' operation to differentiation? Why do we always add the constant of integration 'C' to the result?"
    * **Prompt 1.2:** "Show me a table of indefinite integrals for basic functions that inverts the derivative table."

* **Step 2: Practice and interactive tasks**
    * **Prompt 1.3:** "We know the derivative of x² is 2x. Guide me through finding the indefinite integral of f(x)=2x. Let's verify we get x² + C."

* **Step 3: Mini-quiz**
    * **Prompt 1.4:** "Give me 3 simple functions (e.g., polynomials) and ask me to find their indefinite integrals. Check my results."

## Topic 2: Definite integral and its geometric interpretation

**Key concepts:** In this section you'll learn: definite integral, limits of integration, geometric interpretation (area under a curve), and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Newton-Leibniz formula).

* **Step 1: Building intuition**
    * **Prompt 2.1:** "What is the definite integral? Explain intuitively how it relates to computing the area under the graph of a function using the idea of Riemann sums (dividing the area into small rectangles)."
    * **Prompt 2.2:** "What does the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (Newton-Leibniz formula) state? How does it connect the definite integral (area) with the indefinite integral (antiderivative)? Why is this one of the most important theorems in mathematics?"

* **Step 2: Practice and interactive tasks**
    * **Prompt 2.3:** "Let's compute together the area under f(x)=2x on the interval from 0 to 3. Guide me step by step applying the Newton-Leibniz formula. Let's check the result matches the geometric formula for the area of a triangle."

* **Step 3: Mini-sprawdzian**
    * **Prompt 2.4:** "Give me a simple function and an interval. Ask me to compute the definite integral of that function over the interval. Check my result."

## Topic 3: Basic integration methods

**Key concepts:** In this section you'll learn: substitution method (change of variables) and integration by parts.

* **Step 1: Building intuition**
    * **Prompt 3.1:** "Explain what the substitution method is. With which differentiation rule is it related? (Hint: the chain rule)"
    * **Prompt 3.2:** "Explain what integration by parts is. With which differentiation rule is it related? (Hint: product rule)"

* **Step 2: Practice and interactive tasks**
    * **Prompt 3.3:** "Let's compute the integral of f(x)=2x * cos(x²) together. Guide me step by step using substitution."
    * **Prompt 3.4:** "Now compute the integral of f(x)=x * cos(x) together. Guide me step by step using integration by parts."

* **Step 3: Mini-quiz**
    * **Prompt 3.5:** "Give me 2 problems: one for substitution and one for integration by parts. Check my results."

## Topic 4: Applications of integrals

**Key concepts:** In this section you'll see how to use integrals to compute area, the volume of a solid of revolution, and arc length.

* **Step 1: Building intuition**
    * **Prompt 4.1:** "Besides area under a curve, what else can we compute with integrals? Briefly explain how to use the definite integral to compute the volume of a solid obtained by rotating a curve around the x-axis."
    * **Prompt 4.2:** "What is the formula for the arc length of a curve expressed using an integral?"

* **Step 2: Practice and interactive tasks**
    * **Prompt 4.3:** "We want to compute the volume of a sphere of radius R. We know the sphere is generated by rotating the semicircle y = sqrt(R² - x²) around the x-axis. Guide me through writing the integral that would compute this volume."

* **Step 3: Mini-quiz**
    * **Prompt 4.4:** "Give me a simple function and ask me to write (without computing) the integral that represents the area under its graph on a given interval and the volume of the solid generated by rotating it."

## Finale: Test your knowledge and prepare for the final step

**Step 1: Final test**

* **Prompt 5.1:** "Prepare a combined test on integrals. I want 3 problems: 1. Compute a simple definite integral. 2. An integral to solve by parts. 3. An integral to solve by substitution."

**Step 2: What's next? Preview of the last module**

* **Prompt 6.1 (Preview):** "I have mastered derivatives and integrals. What happens if we combine these two worlds and start looking for functions based on relationships between them and their derivatives? Give me a short, one-sentence preview of what 'differential equations' are and why they are so important in describing the world."

Good luck on your journey through analysis!
