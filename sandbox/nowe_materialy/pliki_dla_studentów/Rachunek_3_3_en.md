# Student Guide: Learning Differential Calculus with Your AI Assistant

Welcome to an interactive guide to mathematical analysis! In this part we will learn one of the most powerful tools of mathematics: the derivative, which allows us to measure and analyze change.

## Key to success: your activity and curiosity

**You are in charge of your learning!**

* Don't understand a term? Ask the AI: "Explain the chain rule with a simple example."
* An example is unclear? Ask for another: "Can you show me how to find extrema of another function?"
* Want to check yourself? Verify your thinking: "If I understand correctly, a positive derivative means the function is increasing, and a negative derivative means it is decreasing, right?"

**Take responsibility for your learning**

Approach this task diligently. The goal is understanding. Failure to master the material will be your failure. Use this opportunity wisely.

## Topic 1: Definition and interpretation of the derivative

**Key concepts:** In this section you'll learn: difference quotient, definition of the derivative as a limit, geometric interpretation (tangent) and physical interpretation (instantaneous velocity).

* **Step 1: Building intuition**
    * **Prompt 1.1:** "Explain step by step how we arrive at the definition of the derivative. Start from the secant line and the average rate of change, then show how, via a limiting process (bringing points closer), we obtain the tangent and the derivative (instantaneous rate of change)."
    * **Prompt 1.2:** "What is the geometric interpretation of the derivative at a point? What does its sign (positive, negative, zero) tell us about the behavior of the function near that point?"

* **Step 2: Practice and interactive tasks**
    * **Prompt 1.3:** "Let's compute the derivative of f(x)=x² at x=3 using the definition (the limit of the difference quotient). Guide me through all algebraic steps."

* **Step 3: Mini-quiz**
    * **Prompt 1.4:** "Give me 3 conceptual questions about the definition and interpretation of the derivative. One should concern the relationship between existence of the derivative and continuity of the function."

## Topic 2: Differentiation formulas and rules

**Key concepts:** In this section you'll learn: formulas for derivatives of basic functions (constant, power, trigonometric), differentiation rules (sum, product, quotient), and the chain rule.

* **Step 1: Building intuition**
    * **Prompt 2.1:** "Show me a table of derivative formulas for basic functions such as f(x)=c, f(x)=x^n, f(x)=sin(x), f(x)=cos(x), f(x)=e^x, f(x)=ln(x)."
    * **Prompt 2.2:** "Explain with simple examples how differentiation rules work: derivative of a sum, product and quotient."
    * **Prompt 2.3:** "What is the chain rule for composite functions? Explain it using the example f(x)=sin(x²)."

* **Step 2: Practice and interactive tasks**
    * **Prompt 2.4:** "Compute the derivative of f(x)=x²*sin(x) together. Guide me step by step using the product rule."
    * **Prompt 2.5:** "Now try something harder: f(x)=e^{3x}. Guide me through applying the chain rule."

* **Step 3: Mini-quiz**
    * **Prompt 2.6:** "Give me 3 functions to differentiate, each requiring a different rule (product, quotient, chain). Check my results."

## Topic 3: Applications of derivatives and higher-order derivatives

**Key concepts:** In this section you'll learn: higher-order derivatives, relationship of the first derivative to monotonicity, relationship of the second derivative to concavity, local extrema, inflection points.

* **Step 1: Building intuition**
    * **Prompt 3.1:** "What is the second derivative and what does it tell us about a function? Explain concavity and convexity and their relation to the sign of the second derivative."
    * **Prompt 3.2:** "How do we use derivatives to find local extrema (maxima and minima) of a function? Explain the necessary condition (first derivative zero) and the sufficient condition (testing the sign of the second derivative)."

* **Step 2: Practice and interactive tasks**
    * **Prompt 3.3:** "Let's perform a full analysis of a simple polynomial, e.g., f(x)=x³-3x. Guide me step by step: 1. Compute f'(x) and find monotonicity intervals. 2. Find local extrema. 3. Compute f''(x) and find concavity/convexity intervals. 4. Find inflection points."

* **Step 3: Mini-quiz**
    * **Prompt 3.4:** "Give me a function and ask me to find its local extrema. Check my answer."

## Finale: Test your knowledge and prepare for the next step

**Step 1: Final test**

* **Prompt 4.1:** "Prepare a combined test on derivatives. I want 3 tasks: 1. Differentiate a complicated function using rules. 2. Find monotonicity intervals of a function. 3. Find local extrema of a function."

**Step 2: Why learn this? Applications of derivatives

* **Prompt 5.1 (Optimization):** "Give me a simple real-world optimization problem. E.g., 'We have 100m of fencing and want to fence a rectangular garden of maximal area.' Show how the derivative helps find the solution."
* **Prompt 5.2 (Physics):** "How are derivatives used in physics to describe motion? Explain the relationship between position, velocity and acceleration via differentiation."

**Step 3: What next? Preview of the next module**

* **Prompt 6.1 (Preview):** "I have mastered derivatives, i.e., the analysis of change. What if I want to reverse the process and reconstruct an original quantity from information about its change? Give me a short, one-sentence preview of what an 'integral' is and how it relates to the derivative."

Good luck on your journey through analysis!
