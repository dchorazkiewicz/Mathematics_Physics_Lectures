# Final Announcement


**Dear All,**

This is practically the end of our course. Congratulations to those who passed the lab! Please check your lab grades in the Verbis system as they have been posted.

As I mentioned at the beginning, the minimum requirement for passing is obtaining 50% of the points from the tests. The final grade will depend on the number of points earned and participation in the classes.

Those who earned a high number of points but never attended the classes cannot expect a grade higher than 4.0. If anyone disagrees with their grade, please come to any of my classes and convince me that you deserve a higher grade. Convincing me will involve answering questions related to the course topics. If you cannot answer simple questions, your grade may be lowered to 2.0, necessitating a retake exam in September.

Those who did not pass the exercises due to a low score have the opportunity to pass by taking a test in the last week. Scoring 50% or more results in a grade of 3.0. If you wish to obtain a higher grade, you may try to earn more points in the same way as those who passed the exercises but disagree with the grade. In such cases, come to any of my classes and try to convince me that you deserve a higher grade.

From the beginning, I have emphasized that participation in classes is very important! Please remember that you are still in the process of passing the lab!

I remind you that you are participating in higher education, and there are certain minimum requirements that must be met. One of these is the ability to read and reason. Below, I will present the most common questions and my answers. Failure to understand the text below may result in not passing the lab, and consequently, not passing the course. Asking me a similar question in private chat without reading and understanding this text may also result in not passing the lab due to a lack of reading and reasoning skills.

Collection of situations and assigned actions:
A person who did not pass the exercises and did not attend the classes:

May take the test in the last week and receive a grade of 3.0.
If they accept the grade given for the test, they can rest easy.
If they do not agree with the grade, they have the opportunity to persuade the instructor to raise the grade according to previously described rules.

As I mentioned earlier, if someone disagrees with the grade, I invite them to my classes. You are not limited to those you are enrolled in. Below I present the schedule of my classes, which you can attend regardless of which group you belong to:

* Monday, 4:40PM-6:10PM
* Tuesday, 8:00AM-9:30AM
* Thursday, 8:00AM-9:30AM
* Thursday, 4:40PM-6:10PM
* Friday, 4:45PM-6:15PM
* Friday, 6:30PM-8:00PM

Please note that this is 9 hours of available class times, so everyone should find time to come and convince me that they deserve a higher grade.

Please be prepared for the discussion. Things required:

* notes from the lists covered in the classes,
* notes from the tests, if that will be involved in the improvement,
* a record of activity in the classes; Teams has the functionality that shows whether you participated in the classes or not,
* most importantly: an understanding of the material covered in the classes. Passive(!) reading from GPT will be graded at 2.0.
