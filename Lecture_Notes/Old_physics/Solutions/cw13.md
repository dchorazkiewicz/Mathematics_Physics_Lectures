# Quantum Mechanics Exercises

## 1. Number of distinct wave functions $\psi_{n,l,m}$ in a hydrogen atom for $n=2$

For $n=2$, the possible values of $l$ are $0$ and $1$. For each $l$, the possible values of $m$ are:

- For $l=0$: $m=0$
- For $l=1$: $m=-1, 0, 1$

Thus, the number of distinct wave functions $\psi_{n,l,m}$ for $n=2$ is $1 + 3 = 4$.

## 2. General dependency between energy $E$ and excited number $n$

(a) Potential well: $E \sim n^2$

(b) Hydrogen atom: $E \sim \frac{1}{n^2}$

## 3. Probability of finding the particle between $x = 0$ and $x = L/2$

Given the wavefunction $\Psi(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{L}} \sin\left(\frac{\pi x}{L}\right)$ in a one-dimensional box of length $L$, the probability $P$ of finding the particle between $x=0$ and $x=\frac{L}{2}$ is:

$$
P = \int_{0}^{L/2} |\Psi(x)|^2 dx = \int_{0}^{L/2} \left(\sqrt{\frac{2}{L}} \sin\left(\frac{\pi x}{L}\right)\right)^2 dx = \int_{0}^{L/2} \frac{2}{L} \sin^2\left(\frac{\pi x}{L}\right) dx
$$

Using the identity $\sin^2\theta = \frac{1 - \cos(2\theta)}{2}$:

$$
P = \frac{2}{L} \int_{0}^{L/2} \frac{1 - \cos\left(\frac{2\pi x}{L}\right)}{2} dx = \frac{1}{L} \int_{0}^{L/2} 1 - \cos\left(\frac{2\pi x}{L}\right) dx
$$

Integrating:

$$
P = \frac{1}{L} \left[ x - \frac{L}{2\pi} \sin\left(\frac{2\pi x}{L}\right) \right]_{0}^{L/2} = \frac{1}{L} \left[ \frac{L}{2} - \frac{L}{2\pi} \sin(\pi) \right] = \frac{1}{L} \cdot \frac{L}{2} = \frac{1}{2}
$$

Thus, the probability of finding the particle between $x=0$ and $x=\frac{L}{2}$ is $0.5$.

## 4. Energy of the electron in a one-dimensional infinite potential well

Given $\Psi(x) = \sqrt{\frac{2}{L}} \sin\left(\frac{3\pi x}{L}\right)$ and $L=1$ nm, the energy $E$ is:

$$
E_n = \frac{n^2 \pi^2 \hbar^2}{2mL^2}
$$

For $n=3$ and $L=1$ nm:

$$
E_3 = \frac{3^2 \pi^2 \hbar^2}{2m (1 \times 10^{-9} m)^2} = \frac{9 \pi^2 \hbar^2}{2m (1 \times 10^{-18} m^2)}
$$

Using $\hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} J \cdot s$ and $m = 9.10938356 \times 10^{-31} kg$:

$$
E_3 = \frac{9 \pi^2 (1.0545718 \times 10^{-34})^2}{2 \times 9.10938356 \times 10^{-31} \times 10^{-18}} J
$$

Calculating this:

$$
E_3 \approx 1.50 \times 10^{-18} J = 9.37 eV
$$

Thus, the energy of the electron is approximately $9.37$ eV.

## 5. Particle composed of two up quarks and one down quark

The particle composed of two up quarks (each with a charge of +2/3) and one down quark (with a charge of -1/3) is a proton.

## 6. Age of the sample with 1/4 of the original amount of carbon-14 isotope

The half-life of carbon-14 is approximately 5730 years. If a sample contains $1/4$ of the original amount, it has gone through two half-lives:

$$\text{Age} = 2 \times 5730 \text{ years} = 11460 \text{ years}$$

Thus, the age of the sample is $11460$ years.

## 7. Half-life of Uranium-238

The half-life of Uranium-238 is approximately $4.468 \times 10^9$ years.

## 8. Example of alpha decay

An example of alpha decay is the decay of Uranium-238:

$$^{238}_{92}U \rightarrow ^{234}_{90}Th + ^{4}_{2}He$$

## 9. Example of beta minus decay

An example of beta minus decay is the decay of Carbon-14:

$$^{14}_{6}C \rightarrow ^{14}_{7}N + e^- + \bar{\nu}_e$$

## 10. Example of beta plus decay

An example of beta plus decay is the decay of Fluorine-18:

$$^{18}_{9}F \rightarrow ^{18}_{8}O + e^+ + \nu_e$$
