## Lorentz force

The Lorentz force is the force experienced by a charged particle moving in an electromagnetic field. It is given by the equation:

$$
\mathbf{F} = q(\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v} \times \mathbf{B})
$$

where:
- $\mathbf{F}$ is the Lorentz force,
- $q$ is the charge of the particle,
- $\mathbf{E}$ is the electric field,
- $\mathbf{v}$ is the velocity of the particle,
- $\mathbf{B}$ is the magnetic field,
- $\times$ denotes the cross product.
- $\mathbf{F}$ is a vector quantity, and it can be expressed in terms of its components in the Cartesian coordinate system as:

$$
\mathbf{F} = (F_x, F_y, F_z) = q(E_x + v_y B_z - v_z B_y, E_y + v_z B_x - v_x B_z, E_z + v_x B_y - v_y B_x)
$$

where:
- $F_x$, $F_y$, and $F_z$ are the components of the Lorentz force in the x, y, and z directions, respectively,
- $E_x$, $E_y$, and $E_z$ are the components of the electric field,
- $v_x$, $v_y$, and $v_z$ are the components of the velocity,
- $B_x$, $B_y$, and $B_z$ are the components of the magnetic field.

The Lorentz force is responsible for the motion of charged particles in electric and magnetic fields, and it plays a crucial role in many physical phenomena, including the behavior of charged particles in accelerators, the operation of electric motors, and the dynamics of plasmas.
